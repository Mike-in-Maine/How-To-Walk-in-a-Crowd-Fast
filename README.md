# How-To-Walk-in-a-Crowd-Fast
This project refers to a simple problem: have you ever been stuck in a crowded room and tried to get out of it fast? Whats the best rout to take between standing still and moving people? What about moving with a crowd in a narrow street andf there are people walking one way and the opposite way? What is the fastest way to get ahead? Certainly not to just keep following the crowd. But how then? Common tactics to be tested are: - walk close to the 2 walls, - zigzag between people, - follow closely behind one person, take over them and follow the next one and repeat. Does it make a difference if you ask "scuse me coming through"?

One-sentence pitch: what this project does and why it matters.
