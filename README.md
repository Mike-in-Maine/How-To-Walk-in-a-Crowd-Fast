# How-To-Walk-in-a-Crowd-Fast
This project refers to a simple problem: have you ever been stuck in a crowded room and tried to get out of it fast? Whats the best rout to take between standing still and moving people? What about moving with a crowd in a narrow street andf there are people walking one way and the opposite way? What is the fastest way to get ahead? Certainly not to just keep following the crowd. But how then? Common tactics to be tested are: - walk close to the 2 walls, - zigzag between people, - follow closely behind one person, take over them and follow the next one and repeat. Does it make a difference if you ask "scuse me coming through"?

The setup.
The first thing we need to do is to record a bunch of crows of people walking. This will give us an idea of how crowds behave

Imagine you have to join a friend at the end of a street that is waiting for you and you are already late and she is texing you "Where are you?" Imagin now that the street is crowded with people coming your same direction, other people walking the opposite direction, some stopping unexpectedly to check out a pair of shoes they saw in a window, others turning around and going the opposite direction.
The question is: Is there a strategy to adopt with its own pattern, that will lead to the fastest way to walk through such an unpredictable crowd, or it doesnt really matter?
